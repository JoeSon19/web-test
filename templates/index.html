    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I specialize in the fields of bacteriology and space life science, with extensive research experience in bacterial pathogenesis, molecular genetic engineering, biofilms, space biology, vaccine development, and host-pathogen interaction. To conduct my research, I have utilized a range of human surrogate infection models, such as 3-D tissue culture models, worms, mice, and chickens, with a focus on vaccine development.

    My current research interests are focused on understanding microbial interactions in mixed populations and their long-term effects on human health and the environment, both on Earth and in space. Specifically, I aim to explore how the interactions between microbial communities within complex ecosystems can contribute to their pathogenicity, persistence, and species evolution. The ultimate goal of my study is to better understand complex bacterial interactions within heterogeneous populations and their long-term impact on human health and living environments, thus contributing to enhancing the sustainability of life on Earth and in space.

    I was awarded an Alfred P. Sloan Postdoctoral Fellowship, jointly funded by NASA, to study microbiome of the International Space Station. I published on genomics, bacterial pathogenesis, vaccine development, 3-D tissue engineering, microbiome, and space microbiology. I am currently participating multiple spaceflight projects and serving as a single PI for a NASA-funded project focused on investigating bacterial interspecies interactions and the long-term changes in Earth or space environment. My approach involves utilizing multi-directional comparison analysis and systemic approaches to advance our understanding of microbial interactions in complex environments. I have been the recipient of several awards and research funding, including the ASM Peggy Cotter Early Career Award and an Outstanding Teaching Award.</p>
